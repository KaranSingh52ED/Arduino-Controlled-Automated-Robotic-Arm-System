# Mechatronics Lab - Arduino Codes

This repository contains Arduino code developed for the **ED5080 - Design of Mechatronic Systems** course at **IIT Madras**. The primary focus of this project is the **Arduino-Controlled Automated Robotic Arm System**.

## Project Overview
The **Automated Robotic Arm System** is designed to perform precise movements and automated tasks using an Arduino-based control mechanism. The system integrates various sensors, actuators, and control algorithms to achieve efficient robotic motion.

## Repository Contents
- **Problem Statement**: Problem Statement Question Paper.
- **Arduino Codes**: Implementation of control algorithms for robotic arm movement.
- **Documentation**: Reports and explanations of the system architecture.
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Schematics for hardware integration.

## Team Members
The project was collaboratively developed by the following students from the **Engineering Design Department (Batch 2022)**:

| Name            | Roll Number |
|---------------|------------|
| **Karan Singh** | ED22B052 |
| **Kanishq Garg** | ED22B051 |
| **Harsh Kumar** | ED22B049 |
